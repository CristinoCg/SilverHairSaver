# SilverHairSaver
The goal of this project is monitoring and get information about life status of old people

<h2>How to use?</h2>
You have a pipfile with all the dependencies needed to run the project but you may need a device to send data to the 'topic' in the HiveMQ server. To get the things ready to run the code:
<ul>
  <li>Run "python -m pip install pipenv"</li>
  <li>Run "pipenv shell"</li>
  <li>Run "pipenv install --dev"</li>
  <li>Run "python manage.py runserver"</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to send data?</h3>
You can use a python script with paho-mqtt just for testing purpose and debugging. I'll add the arduino file soon
